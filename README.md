# MTSP-using-sectors
An attempt at solving the Multiple Travelling Salesman Problem.

This project was made for the Pravega Hackathon - 2021.

Please refer to 'Project on MTSP - Pravega.pdf' for details regarding how the code works.

Note: This is the second implementation of the MTSP algorithm. The code structure has chanaged drastically.

# Running the program

To run the program, first clone this repository to a local directory.

Then run the following command in a terminal opened from this directory to install all required dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Finally run general_line_division.py from the same terminal and input the parameters to see the program in action.

```
python main.py
```

If the above command raises an error, try the following command:

```
python3 main.py
```
